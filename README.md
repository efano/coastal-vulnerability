# Sea-level Rise Vulnerability of Contiguous U.S. Coastal Beaches

### by Lis Fano

This web map visualizes the relative susceptibility of coastal beaches to sea-level rise through the use
of a coastal vulnerability index (CVI). The initial classification used in the CVI is based upon the
following variables: geomorphology, regional coastal slope, tide range, wave height,
relative sea-level rise and shoreline erosion and accretion rates. The combination of these variables
and the association of these variables to each other furnish a broad overview of beaches where physical
changes are likely to occur due to sea-level rise. Additional CVI information can be found at the [National Assessment of Coastal Change Hazards website](https://www.usgs.gov/natural-hazards/coastal-marine-hazards-and-resources/science/national-assessment-coastal-change-hazards?qt-science_center_objects=0#qt-science_center_objects).

## Data Sources

Data for this project were obtained from the [USGS Coastal Change Hazards Portal](https://marine.usgs.gov/coastalchangehazardsportal/ui/info/item/CDKmLpj) and the [U.S. Board on Geographic Names GNIS](https://www.usgs.gov/core-science-systems/ngp/board-on-geographic-names/download-gnis-data).

## Data Processing Steps

- Using Node.js to filter the beach data from the rest of the GNIS data: process-beaches.js

- Buffer PACIFIC.shp, ATLANTIC.shp, and GULF.shp polylines to polygons:

```bash
ogr2ogr -f "ESRI Shapefile" -dialect SQLite -sql "select SEA_LEVEL, SLOPE, TIDES, WAVES, EROSION, GEOMORPH, CVI, ID_COAST, ST_Buffer(geometry, .05) from PACIFIC" PAC-buffer.shp PACIFIC.shp
```

```bash
ogr2ogr -f "ESRI Shapefile" -dialect SQLite -sql "select SEA_LEVEL, SLOPE, TIDES, WAVES, EROSION, GEOMORPH, CVI, ID_COAST, ST_Buffer(geometry, .05) from ATLANTIC" ATL-buffer.shp ATLANTIC.shp
```

```bash
ogr2ogr -f "ESRI Shapefile" -dialect SQLite -sql "select SEA_LEVEL, SLOPE, TIDES, WAVES, EROSION, GEOMORPH, CVI, ID_COAST, ST_Buffer(geometry, .05) from GULF" GULF-buffer.shp GULF.shp
```

- Combine/merge the three shapefiles:

```bash
mapshaper -i PAC-buffer.shp ATL-buffer.shp GULF-buffer.shp combine-files -merge-layers -o CVI-merge.shp
```

- Convert the US-beaches.json to shapefile to perform a spatial join with the merged CVI polygons:

```bash
ogr2ogr -f "ESRI Shapefile" US-beaches.shp US-beaches.json  
```

- Perform the spatial join by location (point in polygon):

```bash
mapshaper US-beaches.shp -join CVI-merge.shp -o US-beaches-join.shp
```

- Remove the non-coastal beach points where join is null:

```bash
ogr2ogr -f "ESRI Shapefile" -where "CVI is not null" all-beaches.shp US-beaches-join.shp
```

- Convert the shapefile to json:

```bash
mapshaper all-beaches.shp -o precision=.00001 format=geojson all-beaches.json
```

- Build the web map using the all-beaches.json file.
